## Project

### Name & Category
- **Project**: Proof-of-Skill Resume
- **Category**: Identity

### Description
- Proof-of-Skill Resume is a decentralized, verifiable credential platform that allows users to showcase their skills, certifications, and work history with cryptographic proofs.
Unlike traditional resumes or LinkedIn, this vApp ensures each claim is backed by zero-knowledge proofs on the Soundness Layer (SL), enabling instant verification of authenticity while preserving privacy.
Employers, DAOs, or communities can validate candidate skills without relying on centralized intermediaries or exposing personal data.

### SL Integration  
- Use Soundness CLI to generate verifiable proofs for each submitted credential.
- Credentials and proofs are stored off-chain but anchored to the SL for validation.
- Verification requests are processed via SL’s fast proof validation, ensuring low-latency skill checks.
- Integrates with Discord roles or DAO membership gating based on verified skill proofs.

## Technical

### Architecture
1. User Interface (Web dApp) → Users create digital resumes, add skills/certifications.
2. Proof Engine → Uses Soundness Layer CLI to generate cryptographic proofs of authenticity.
3. Off-chain Storage → User credentials stored securely (e.g., IPFS/Arweave).
4. SL Integration Layer → Anchors proofs into Soundness Layer for instant third-party verification.
5. Verifier Portal → Employers or DAOs can verify skills in seconds by checking against SL.

### Stack
- **Frontend**: React + Next.js
- **Smart Contracts**: Solidity / Foundry (for credential anchors)
- **Backend**: Node.js + Express (API + proof generation logic)
- **Storage**: IPFS / Arweave for credentials metadata

### Features
1. Create decentralized, verifiable resumes with cryptographic proofs.
2. Employers/DAOs can instantly validate candidate skills without central intermediaries.
3. Privacy-preserving skill validation using zero-knowledge proofs.

## Timeline

### PoC (2-4 weeks)
- [ ] Build minimal UI for creating and submitting credentials.
- [ ] Integrate Soundness CLI to generate simple skill proofs.
- [ ] Store credentials metadata on IPFS.

### MVP (4-8 weeks)  
- [ ] Expand UI for full resume builder with proof anchoring.
- [ ] Develop verifier portal for employers/DAOs.
- [ ]  Add Discord/DAO role integration based on proof verification.

## Innovation
- This vApp bridges the gap between Web2 resumes and Web3 identity by combining verifiable credentials, zero-knowledge proofs, and decentralized storage. It enables global, trustless hiring and community participation while preserving user privacy.
